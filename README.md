Vinci World goal is to be a revolutionary blockchain-based gaming platform, intertwining the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with the thrilling world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Players will be able to train different characters using reinforcement learning and later on they will be able to mint them as NFTs and enter different tournaments / challenges.

## Vinci World Programs - Current state and Architecture

In this program, all the user relevant data (amount of Vinci Tokens, general score, etc) will be stored. This information can then be accessed by other Vinci Programs through Cross Program Invocations
The Vinci Accounts programs also provides mint and burn functions for tokens and NFTs

- Program where the user will be able to trade assets to improve his character

In this program, a Swap program is being built. This swap program will allow users to trade assets (tokens) in order to fine tune their model training. This swap program is backed by a constant product algorithm, making the price of a certain token vary according to the available liquidity. By doing this, we ensure that the gameplay remains strategic and addictive.
